The original data file is WIT_study1_raw.txt.

In script 1_Scherer_Study1_Refine:
	Irrelevant columns and rows are dropped.
	Minority participants are labeled as such.
	Subject IDs are updated according to experiment so that it's obviously between-subjects.
	Data is exported as "WIT_study1_refined.txt".

In script 2_Scherer_Study1_QC:
	A value for minimum acceptible accuracy is found.
	Subjects who did not meet this minimum accuracy are identified.
	These subject numbers are exported as "WIT_study1_badsubs.txt".

In script 3_Scherer_Study1_grouping:
	Bad and minority subjects are excluded.
	Data is aggregated for each trial type within each subject, leaving a mean accuracy for a given trial type for each subject.
	RT data for correct trials only are similarly aggregated within trial types within subjecs, leaving mean RTs.
	These two DVs are exported in a single table, "WIT_study1_SASdat.txt".

In script 4_Scherer_Study1_PDP:
	A new dataset is made which contains two A and two C parameter estimates for each subject.
	This is exported as "WIT_study1_PDPdata.txt"

In script 5_Scherer_Study1_tables:
	Tables are generated.

Data can then be analyzed with SAS scripts 6_Study1_SAS-analysis.SAS and 7_Study1_SAS-analysis_PDP.SAS.
